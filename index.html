					<h2><a href="index.html">Dragon Evo</a></h2>
					<p>
						Dragon Evo is a browser-based CCG that mixes in plenty of RPG-style elements into a game that casts you as the warlord of a powerful faction intent on ruling the land of Tyrenir. Build your deck, form alliances, attack your enemies, and defend your homeland to bring victory to your army!

You’ll choose from among three factions, four races, and four classes for your character, whom you can level up during game play and equip with powerful items. There’s a full storyline for each of the three factions, and you can buy and even trade cards among players.

			<h2><a href="index.html">What is Dragon Evo:TCG</a></h2>
				<p>
					Dragon Evo:TCG is an online card game with elements of RPG and tradition CCGs. The game is set in the Dragon Evo fantasy universe, where you must choose one of the rivaling factions on the continent of Erendor. Choose your path wisely - bring peace and balance to the land or complete domination.

				<h2><a href="index.html">Login Rewards</a></h2>				
				<p>We are also implementing daily rewards/login rewards.

<p> When logging in you will be presented with a login reward screen for each subsequent day you login. The reward will be a random low or normal type world card, added to your deck. Keep in mind that during Early Access, these cards reset as part of the weekly reset.

<p>As soon as the gameplay foundation is laid and the functionality is present, this reward system will also deal out consumable cards (such as healing potions) and item cards to improve your decks.

<p>This feature is not complete yet, but we're planning to roll it out either during this week or as part of the next devlog / weekly update.
