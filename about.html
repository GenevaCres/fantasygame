			<p>This is the first look on the new gameplay in Dragon Evo. Keep in mind this is pre-alpha gameplay and much is not implemented.

					<li>
						<h2><a href="about.html">AI</a></h2>
						<p>
							This basic AI also serves as the starting foundation for our single player modes (quest, training, story, etc), and will get better with time. For now, expect mildly dumb opposition and stunning, unexpected moves.
						</p>
						<p>Defeating the AI gives you the same rewards in multiplayer as a PVP match and allows everyone to play the game and improve their skill without having to wait for other players or deal with those pesky humans.
						<p>Test your skills against the AI under "Singleplayer" -> "Training".
